Pong in Unity.

1. phase - Follow tutorials to make the base game.
2. phase - Add to the game

What I plan to add to the game after I finish the core:
* Polish the game a little bit
* Add more layouts
* Add multiplayer
  * Add hotseat
  * Add different options for multiplayer (handicap, time limit, score limit, layouts)
  * Add online multiplayer
* Add my own sound effects

If you have problems with TextMeshPro, delete the folder and download TextMeshPro from the Asset Store.
